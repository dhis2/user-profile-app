In **Edit user profile**, you can add personal information to your profile
such as your email address, mobile phone number, date of birth, profile
picture and more. When you send messages, the person receiving the message can see these
profile details. You can also provide account names for various direct
messaging services, which will be used by the system.

In **Edit user settings**, you can change the display language of DHIS2 and
the language of the database. The database language is the translated
content of the metadata, such as data elements and indicators. You can
also choose a display style, and enable or disable SMS and email
notifications. If you wish to, you can choose to display a short name,
such as "Joe" in the analysis modules, rather than your full name.

In **Edit account settings**, you can reset your password and setup 2-Factor
authentication. Setting up 2-Factor authentication will require you to
download an authenticator app such as the Google Authenticator app on your mobile device.

In the **View full profile** section, you find a summary of your profile details.
This section includes a few fields that you cannot edit yourself,
such as user roles and user organisation units.

In **Manage personal access tokens** you can view the existing personal access
tokens, revoke existing tokens and generate new ones. Personal access tokens are
an alternative to using passwords for authentication and useful for providing
(restricted) access to scripts and external applications. Note that the values of
newly generated personal access tokens are only visible right after generating.

In the **About DHIS2** section, you find a list of details about the DHIS2 instance.
