In **Edit user profile**, you can update personal information like your email address, mobile number, date of birth, profile picture, and more. These details are visible to others when you send messages. You can also provide account names for direct messaging services used by the system. If your email address is set and the system is configured to send emails, a Verify Email button will appear next to your email address.

If your email is set and email notifications are enabled, you can verify your email here. An unverified email will trigger a warning, and you may be restricted from certain actions that require verification.

In **Edit user settings**, you can change the display language of DHIS2 and
the language of the database. The database language is the translated
content of the metadata, such as data elements and indicators. You can
also choose a display style, and enable or disable SMS and email
notifications. If you wish to, you can choose to display a short name,
such as "Joe" in the analysis modules, rather than your full name.

In **Edit account settings**, you can reset your password and set up 2-Factor Authentication (2FA). Depending on your system configuration, you can choose between methods like TOTP or email-based verification to complete the setup.

In the **View full profile** section, you find a summary of your profile details.
This section includes a few fields that you cannot edit yourself,
such as user roles and user organisation units.

In **Manage personal access tokens** you can view the existing personal access
tokens, revoke existing tokens and generate new ones. Personal access tokens are
an alternative to using passwords for authentication and useful for providing
(restricted) access to scripts and external applications. Note that the values of
newly generated personal access tokens are only visible right after generating.

In the **About DHIS2** section, you find a list of details about the DHIS2 instance.

## Setting up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

### What is 2FA?

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is an extra layer of security for your DHIS2 account. When 2FA is enabled, you’ll need to provide a second verification method (in addition to your password) to access your account. The available methods for 2FA are:

-   **TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)**: Typically, this is configured via an app such as Google Authenticator or Authy.
-   **Email-based verification**: A code will be sent to your email address, which you will need to enter to complete the login process.

> **Note**: 2FA is highly recommended for added account security.

---

### Accessing the 2FA Settings Page

To enable or disable 2FA on your account, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your **User Profile** in DHIS2.
2. In the sidebar, locate and select the **Two Factor Authentication** option.
3. The **Two Factor Authentication** page will open, where you can configure your 2FA settings based on what the system allows.

---

### System Configuration for 2FA

Depending on your DHIS2 instance’s configuration, you may have one or both of the following 2FA options available:

-   **TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)**: This option allows you to authenticate via an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy.
-   **Email-based 2FA**: This option sends a code to your email address, which you need to enter to complete the login process.

The system will display the available 2FA options based on what has been configured by your administrator.

> **Tip**: If both TOTP and email-based 2FA are available, you’ll need to choose which one to set up.

---

### If 2FA is Not Set Up

If you have not set up 2FA yet, you will be presented with the following flow:

-   **Radio Button Selection**: You’ll see a radio button selector to choose between TOTP or email-based 2FA. This option will depend on the system configuration.
    -   If both options are enabled, you must select one method to configure.
    -   If only one method is available, you will be guided through the relevant setup workflow.

#### Setting Up TOTP-based 2FA

1. **Download and Install an Authenticator App**: Download an authenticator app like **Google Authenticator** or **Authy** on your mobile device.
2. **Scan the QR Code**: Once installed, scan the provided QR code in the DHIS2 2FA settings page to link your account.
3. **Enter the TOTP**: Enter the code generated by the authenticator app to complete the setup.

---

#### Setting Up Email-based 2FA

If you choose to set up **email-based 2FA**, the following steps will apply:

1. **Email Verification**: If your email has not been verified yet, you will receive a warning informing you that you must first verify your email address before enabling email-based 2FA.

    - You will be provided with a link to the **Edit User Profile** page, where you can verify your email.
    - Once your email is verified, you can proceed with enabling email-based 2FA.

2. **Enter the Code**: After verifying your email, a code will be sent to your email address. Enter the code into the provided field on the 2FA settings page to complete the setup.

---

### If 2FA is Already Set Up

If you have already enabled 2FA, the system will show the current method that is set up. If the system allows both TOTP and email-based 2FA, you will see a radio button with your current selection (either TOTP or email). The option will be disabled, indicating your current 2FA method.

---

### Disabling 2FA

If you wish to disable 2FA, follow these steps:

1. **Disabling TOTP 2FA**: The process to disable TOTP-based 2FA is the same as enabling it. You’ll need to provide a verification code or follow a confirmation step.
2. **Disabling Email-based 2FA**: Disabling email-based 2FA is similar to the setup process. You’ll receive a code in your email, which you’ll need to enter to disable 2FA.

> **Important Notes**
>
> -   **Single 2FA Configuration at a Time**: You can only have one method of 2FA enabled at a time (either TOTP or email). If both methods are available, you will be required to choose one to configure and use.
>
> -   **Email Verification Required for Email-based 2FA**: Before enabling email-based 2FA, make sure your email address is verified. You won’t be able to set up email-based 2FA until this step is completed.

For detailed information on the 2FA setup for your system, refer to the system settings section or contact your DHIS2 administrator.
